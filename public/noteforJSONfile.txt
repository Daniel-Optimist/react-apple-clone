There are two JSON files in the public folder 
    1. Iphone.json : this is a json file for the iphone product we fetched from our database using postman 
    2. phone.json : this is a json file for apple, samsung,sony, and onePlus ( demonstrated by biruk on filtering a phone by brand) ; I manually typed these while watching Biruk's demo 

Steps for the Iphone.json routing page: 
    1. copy and paste the iphone products json file you retrieved from the database using browser or postman (using this server endpoint: http://localhost:3005/iphones ) 
    2. Go to components-->Pages-->Iphone-->Iphone.jsx and modify the url in the fetch( fetch("http://localhost:3005/iphones")) --> fetch(/iphone.json)
    3. Also, Go to components-->Pages-->SingleAppleProduct-->SingleAppleProduct.jsx and modify the fetch( fetch("http://localhost:3005/iphones")) --> fetch(/iphone.json)
