Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available: The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container. The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
 

 width: calc(50% - 30px):
     - 50%: This means the element will initially take up half of the width of its parent container. So if the parent is 800px wide, 50% would be 400px.
     - 30px: This subtracts 30 pixels from the calculated 50% width. The subtraction is often used to account for padding, margins, or gaps between elements.

    <p className="publish-date">
                    Published on:{" "}
                    {new Date(video.snippet.publishedAt).toLocaleDateString()}
                  </p>
